# Interactive Gallery App build with MVVM with a touch of Clean Architecture
A simple image gallery that fetches data from **Lorem Picsum** API. 

[Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/): Lorem Picsum provides random or specific uploaded images as placeholders. Developers need to specify the desired image size (width & height) at the end of the request URL. Grayscale and blur effects can be applied to any image.

[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=mvvm+architecture+android](MVVM Architecture): This guide encompasses best practices and recommended architecture for building robust, production-quality apps.

## Features
1. Use https://picsum.photos to get a list of photos
2. The user can tap the photo
3. The user can see a full-screen view of the photo
4. The user has an infinite scroll on the gallery screen
5. The appâ€™s a flavor/scheme can be changed easily so that changing from development API to production API becomes trivial
6. Cache images
7. Cache API response
8. Allow saving photos in JPEG format to the local gallery
9. Allow sharing the photo

## Architectural Pattern
* Built with Modern Android Development (MAD) practices
* Utilization of clean architecture and SOLID design principles
* Utilized Usecase, Repository pattern for data
* Includes unit tests for Use cases, Repository, ViewModels, API response
* Dependency Injection using Dragger-Hilt
* Util class to reduce common code duplication
* Full app built with Kotlin 
* Jetpack Components used

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and thread handling 
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - An easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android apps. 
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

- [Zoomage](http://jsibbold.github.io/zoomage/) - A simple pinch-to-zoom ImageView library for Android with an emphasis on a smooth and natural feel.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/) - Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile!
- [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - For writing Gradle build scripts using Kotlin.
- [MockK](https://mockk.io) - For Mocking and Unit Testing.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/) - Glide is a fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory, and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
